## Introduction
For this project I will create a node.js web application using the Hapi framework. The web app will allow a user to crate an account, login, enter a point of interest (beach, historic, outdoor activity etc....). Users and admin's will be able to view all points of interested which will display, point of interest type, name, description and the name of the user who uploaded the information.

## Project
As I continue to develop this app, I will add further information here about features.
